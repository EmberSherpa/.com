* Key Value Observing is used to enable One Way and Two Way binding.
* One way binding is when an object’s value is updated when another object’s value changes.
* Two way binding updates the value of both objects when either object’s property is changed. Two way binding are used to bind Handlebars in templates to properties in Models.
